Usage:

2D_MT: make -f Makefile2d
3D_MT: make -f Makefile3d

Alternatively, run
Configure.2D_MT - to create Makefile for 2D_MT;
Configure.3D_MT - to create Makefile for 3D_MT.
These scripts use fmkmf.pl script, which is an
automatic Makefile generator, and Makefile.local,
which could be hand-edited. Compilers and linked
libraries may be modified in the Configure scripts
or directly in the Makefile that gets created.
The Configure scripts have to be rerun if the
module usage dependencies change or if new source
code is added.

Importing the project from SVN repository into Eclipse:

1) Install Photran and Subeclipse plugins using
   Help -> Software Updates -> Find and Install
2) Go to New -> SVN -> Checkout Projects from SVN
3) Type in repository location
   http://mt.coas.oregonstate.edu/svn/ModEM/trunk
4) Check out the subdirectory f90; if it gives you
   this option (i.e. if .project is not present
   in the repository) check out as new project.
5) If checking out as new project, select
   Fortran Project -> Makefile Project -> GCC Tool Chain
