Note on Impedance:  In the modeling codes (2D, 3D)
everything is in MKS units.  Furthermore, data
functionals are set up to compute magnetic
induction (B NOT H) from the formula curl E = i omega B.
NOTE THAT mu_0 does not enter into this, as it
would if we computed H!  Impedances thus come out
as Z = E/B, in MKS units of (V/m)/T.  To convert
to the usual geophysical units of (mV/km)/nT we thus
need to DIVIDE by 1000.  This must be accounted for
in dealing with real data!!!!!

There has been some confusion about this, and some
notes/documentation/comments in the codes are,
at the very least, misleading (or even WRONG!)
